# Zoltraak Scaffold Activity Log

This log captures the workspace bootstrap and follow-up changes performed while setting up the Zoltraak Phase 1 PERN monorepo.

## Root Workspace
- Added npm workspace manager with shared scripts (`package.json`) and base TypeScript config (`tsconfig.base.json`).
- Provisioned `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres + Redis).
- Initialized directory structure for `apps/backend`, `apps/frontend`, and shared `packages`.

## Backend (apps/backend)
- Scaffolded Express 4 API with modular routing (auth, transactions, budgets, assets, dashboard) and middleware (auth guard, validation, error handling, not-found).
- Integrated Prisma ORM: `schema.prisma`, seed script, env validation, and Prisma client helper.
- Implemented service layers returning shared DTOs, plus controller + router wiring.
- Configured tooling: `tsconfig` (build + watch), ESLint, Vitest placeholder, `.env.example`, README, and npm scripts (dev, build, prisma commands).
- Adjusted build config and JWT typing to support bundler resolution and shared package imports; verified `npm run build --workspace apps/backend`.

## Frontend (apps/frontend)
- Bootstrapped Next.js 15 App Router project with TailwindCSS, shadcn-style UI primitives, and React Query provider.
- Created layout shell, marketing landing page, dashboard view (cards, recent transactions, budgets, assets), plus placeholder pages (transactions, budgets, assets, settings) and auth forms (login/register).
- Added API client, hooks, and styling (`globals.css`, Tailwind config, PostCSS, ESLint, README).
- Tuned Next.js config and tsconfig for v15 (removed deprecated experimental flags, set bundler resolution). Confirmed `npm run build --workspace apps/frontend`.

## Shared Packages
- `@zoltraak/types`: Transaction, budget, asset, dashboard, and user interfaces with barrel export and TypeScript build output.
- `@zoltraak/utils`: Formatting helpers (currency, date, range) and numeric utilities, built for consumption by both apps.
- Updated app imports to consume the package barrel exports and configured build paths for bundler resolution.

## Dependency & Build Notes
- Local workspace links switched from `workspace:*` to relative `file:` references to accommodate npm on Windows.
- Installation performed via `npm install` at repo root; prisma client generated post-install.
- Successful build commands:
  - `npm run build --workspace packages/types`
  - `npm run build --workspace packages/utils`
  - `npm run build --workspace apps/backend`
  - `npm run build --workspace apps/frontend`

This document reflects the state after all scaffolding and build verification tasks were completed.
